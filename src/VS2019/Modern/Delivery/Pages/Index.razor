<h1>Hello, welcome to Modern Delivery Application!</h1>

<p>
    This application demostrates Microsoft newly release Blazor application framework, that
    is compatible with with older Visual Studio 2008 application using techniques of
    routing xml to server and storing information in database.
</p>

@if (IsSimulated == true)
    {
<p>
    This is running with Simulated DataBase service which allows for Azure loading without
    the need for SQL database. ItemCategories and Items are initialized on load of server.
</p>
    }
    else
    {
<p>
    This is running with SQL service which could be replace with simulated services with
    change in configuration,  all SQL service requests are made with Stored Procedures
    Using Dapper.  Limited support for Authorization is provided with Entity Framework.
</p>
    }

<p>
    A typical C++ application sometimes takes a week or more to add some functionality.
    However, with the new Blazor page, functionality can be achieved within minutes
    utilizing the same database and is also portable across multiple platforms..
    Also provided is a WinForm version of similar Legacy Application that is similar to C++
    Legacy application.
